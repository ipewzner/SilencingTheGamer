# Silencing the gamer

## Create by IPewzner

This script is used to remind my brother
to not raise his voice too loud when he 
plays video games.
so to teach him to be quieter when he plays 
I made this script that dims the screen to 
5 seconds when his voice is over the max 
volume.

### If you use it, do it at your own risk!

## Enjoy!
